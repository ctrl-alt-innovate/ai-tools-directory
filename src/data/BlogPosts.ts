## Which Should You Promote?

# How I Built $5K/Month Recurring Revenue from AI Tool Affiliates

Six months ago, I was making $200/month from affiliate marketing. Today, I'm consistently earning **$5,000+/month in recurring commissions** from AI tools alone.

Here's the exact blueprint I used.

Unlike one-time affiliate sales, AI tools offer:
- **30-50% recurring commissions** every month

One customer can be worth **$500-2000+** over their lifetime.

- **Social media**: 10% of signups

### Pillar 3: Tool Portfolio Strategy

My winning portfolio:
1. **Jasper AI**: $1,800/month (high-value customers)
2. **Copy.ai**: $1,200/month (volume play)
3. **Midjourney**: $800/month (creator audience)
